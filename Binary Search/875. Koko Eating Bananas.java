// 875. Koko Eating Bananas
// Koko loves to eat bananas. There are n piles of bananas, the ith pile has piles[i] bananas. The guards have gone and will come back in h hours.

// Koko can decide her bananas-per-hour eating speed of k. Each hour, she chooses some pile of bananas and eats k bananas from that pile. If the pile has less than k bananas, she eats all of them instead and will not eat any more bananas during this hour.

// Koko likes to eat slowly but still wants to finish eating all the bananas before the guards return.

// Return the minimum integer k such that she can eat all the bananas within h hours.

// Example 1:
// Input: piles = [3,6,7,11], h = 8
// Output: 4

// Example 2:
// Input: piles = [30,11,23,4,20], h = 5
// Output: 30
// Example 3:

// Input: piles = [30,11,23,4,20], h = 6
// Output: 23

// Constraints:

// 1 <= piles.length <= 104
// piles.length <= h <= 109
// 1 <= piles[i] <= 109

// ***** C ***** O ***** D ***** E *****
