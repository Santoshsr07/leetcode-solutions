// 1475. Final Prices With a Special Discount in a Shop

// You are given an integer array prices where prices[i] is the price of the ith item in a shop.

// There is a special discount for items in the shop. If you buy the ith item, then you will receive a discount equivalent to prices[j] where j is the minimum index such that j > i and prices[j] <= prices[i]. Otherwise, you will not receive any discount at all.

// Return an integer array answer where answer[i] is the final price you will pay for the ith item of the shop, considering the special discount.

/**
 * Note: The returned array must be malloced, assume caller calls free().
